# Example Test Configuration for pytest
# Copy this to test_config.toml and customize for your environment
#
# This file is used by the snowlib test suite (pytest) to configure
# test database connections and test data locations.
# NOT for general-purpose connection configuration - use connections.toml for that.

[test]
# Profile to use for tests (from connections.toml)
# This profile should have permissions to create/drop/truncate tables
profile = "test"

# Database and schema for test operations
# You may want to provide a dedicated test schema, as tests will create and drop tables
database = "YOUR_TEST_DATABASE"
schema = "YOUR_TEST_SCHEMA"

# Test table names (will be created/dropped during tests)
write_table = "TEST_WRITE_TABLE"
temp_table = "TEST_TEMP_TABLE"
